Please note that your cancellation will either be on hold or shall be considered invalid in case of a wrong cancellation code, or no cancellation code at all.</p>
    <p><strong>Reasons for a refund:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Payment in installments</li>
        <li>If customer wants a full refund they need to inform us within a week on our official email- <a href="mailto:support@sweetdevelopers.com">support@sweetdevelopers.com</a>.</li>
        <li>In case a customer has claimed a refund after the above-mentioned period (1 week), and the customer has made an advance payment, and a significant amount of work is done on the project, the refund will be calculated after evaluating the “cost of the work” done by us.</li>
        <li>For example, If the customer has made 50% advance payment, and the cost of the work done is more than the amount paid, no refunds will be applicable.</li>
        <li>In contrast, if a customer has made an advance payment of 50% and the work done costs less than what was paid, a refund will be given after deducting the cost of the work.</li>
        <li>They can get a refund (considering the deduction due to taxes and account costs) within 90 business days as per the mutual discussion that shall be held regarding this matter.</li>
        <li>Paid extra by mistake</li>
        <li>Did not like the work</li>
